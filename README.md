## Flix Part 1

`TODO://` In the **User Stories section below**, add an `x` in the `-[ ]` like this `- [x]` for any user story you complete. (
#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [ x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

   - [x ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had trouble compiling the project at first. When i first downloaded the app, i kept getting an error of Defualt Activity not found when just opening the project. This was a fairly easy project to code because of the walk through videos but this one error really hindered my progress 
and it took me hours to figure out what the issue was. I eventually just ended up changing  the targetSdkversion and everything in the app source code to from 28 to 27. everything started running properly after that but instead of taking me 3 or 4 hours because of this one problem
it took me around 9.
