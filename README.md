### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had trouble compiling the project at first. When i first downloaded the app, i kept getting an error of Defualt Activity not found when just opening the project. This was a fairly easy project to code because of the walk through videos but this one error really hindered my progress 
and it took me hours to figure out what the issue was. I eventually just ended up changing  the targetSdkversion and everything in the app source code to from 28 to 27. everything started running properly after that but instead of taking me 3 or 4 hours because of this one problem
it took me around 9.
